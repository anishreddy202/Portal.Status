# VDMS Style Library

The VDMS Style Library is based on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com). The original Bootstrap README file is [here](README_BOOTSTRAP.md).

The best way to learn about the style library is to [view the documentation on Github Pages](https://git.edgecastcdn.net/pages/ui/styles/).


## Editing locally

To work with the library locally (for example, if you are making changes to it), try the following setup instructions.

If you don't have Jekyll, install it (requires Ruby):

    sudo gem install jekyll

You might need to restart your terminal program for the jekyll command to work.

Of course, you'll need the repo:

    git clone https://git.edgecastcdn.net/ui/styles.git
	cd styles

Then to run the documentation server locally:

    jekyll serve -w

And point your browser to [http://localhost:9001/pages/ui/styles/](http://localhost:9001/pages/ui/styles/).
